A basic Amazon.com "clone."  Used by me to explore and solidify new rails concepts.

- Users have the ability to create accounts, sign in, log out, create new products and link images to the product.
  (Not yet able to upload images)

New features learned:

- Added a search function via the 'Ransack' gem

- Created pagination via the 'will_paginate' gem

- Explored internationalization via the 'i18n' gem using the online tutorials as well as my own knowledge of the language.
